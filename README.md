Project Title: Resize Images to Fit Social Media Requirements


Project Description: This tool allows easy conversion of images into the sizes preferred by Facebook, X (aka Twitter), LinkedIn, and Instagram.  Works with .BMP, .JPG/.JPEG, .GIF, and .PNG filetypes.  Saves to .PNG.  Automatically resizes, adds padding (user chooses color), and upscales (though artifacts should be double-checked for).


Installation: 
	1) Keep the contents of this folder as is (e.g. do not change or move the ‘_internal’ folder).  
	2) To open the program, open the file with the “.exe” extension.
